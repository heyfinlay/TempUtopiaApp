    question: "How fast can we launch?",
    answer: "Most systems go live in 5–7 days once onboarding is complete.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need new software?",
    answer: "Not always. We can build using tools you already use, or recommend a simple stack.",

    answer: "No. The goal is speed and consistency — while keeping your tone and brand voice.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a VA?",
    answer: "Perfect. This reduces their workload and makes sure follow-ups never get missed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you run ads too?",
    answer: "We can, but we don’t lead with it. Systems first — then scale.",
  },
