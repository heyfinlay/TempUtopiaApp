Absolutely — and honestly this is the right move.

What I’m going to give you below is:

✅ A full landing page rewrite (every section)
✅ A visual revamp plan (so it feels premium, modern, Apple-clean)
✅ Copy that is simple enough for a 65-year-old
✅ Stronger structure + more proof + less “agency vibe”
✅ Built around your actual offer: AI lead system → booked calls

Temporary Utopia Landing Page (Full Revamp)

GLOBAL DESIGN DIRECTION (applies to whole page)

Style

Apple-clean + modern startup
	•	white background
	•	soft shadows
	•	subtle gradients
	•	rounded corners (large radius)
	•	clean typography
	•	lots of breathing room

Accent colours
	•	Primary accent: TU green
	•	Secondary accents: subtle blue/pink glow used only for highlight moments

Layout rule

Every section should follow:
Title → 1 sentence → visual block

No walls of text.

⸻

SECTION 1 — HERO (Revamped)

Heading

Turn enquiries into booked calls — automatically.

Subheading (one sentence)

We install an AI follow-up system that replies instantly, qualifies leads, and books appointments while you run your business.

SECTION 2 — SYSTEM DIAGRAM (Swipeable Steps)

(You already have this — but now it sits here.)

Section heading

Here’s the system we install.

One sentence

Swipe through the exact 6-step process that turns a new enquiry into a booked call.

⸻

SECTION 3 — OUTCOMES (Revamped)

Heading

What this improves immediately

Subheading

This is designed to fix the most expensive part of your business: slow follow-up.

4 Outcome Cards
	•	More booked calls
	•	Faster replies
	•	Fewer no-shows
	•	Less admin work

Each card should have:
	•	1 icon
	•	1 line
	•	1 micro sentence

Example:
More booked calls
More people actually make it to your calendar.

⸻

SECTION 4 — DEMO PROOF (BIG missing piece)

Heading

What it looks like in real life

Subheading

This is the exact experience your leads get — and what you see on your side.

3 Visual Demo Cards (VERY IMPORTANT)

Card 1 — AI Conversation
Title: Lead conversation
Subtitle: The system replies instantly and asks the right questions.

(Show a chat UI mock)

Card 2 — Booking Confirmation
Title: Booked appointment
Subtitle: It schedules the call directly into your calendar.

(Show calendar UI)

Card 3 — Dashboard
Title: Simple tracking
Subtitle: You can see every lead, outcome, and next step.

(Show dashboard UI)

⸻

SECTION 5 — WHO THIS IS FOR / NOT FOR (Missing)

Heading

This is built for businesses that sell with conversations.

Subheading

If your business relies on enquiries turning into calls, this works extremely well.

Two Column Block

Perfect for:
	•	Clinics & health services
	•	Trades & local service businesses
	•	High-ticket service providers
	•	Agencies and consultants
	•	Real estate / finance / legal

Not ideal for:
	•	Businesses with no enquiry volume
	•	People who want “more followers”
	•	One-product stores with no sales process

⸻

SECTION 6 — WHAT YOU GET (Deliverables Menu)

Heading

What we install for you

Subheading

You’re not buying software. You’re getting a system installed into your business.

Deliverables List (in premium cards)
	•	AI receptionist + instant replies
	•	Lead qualification flow
	•	Calendar booking integration
	•	SMS + email reminders
	•	Lead dashboard + tracking
	•	Setup, testing, and launch
	•	Ongoing optimisation

⸻

SECTION 7 — WHY TEMPORARY UTOPIA (Missing differentiation)

Heading

Why this works (and why most tools don’t)

Subheading

Most businesses don’t need more leads — they need to stop losing the ones they already have.

3 Comparison Cards

Most “chatbots”
	•	Generic scripts
	•	No booking
	•	No tracking
	•	No optimisation

Most agencies
	•	Sell leads
	•	Don’t fix follow-up
	•	No visibility

Temporary Utopia
	•	We install the system
	•	It books calls
	•	You can see results
	•	We improve it over time

⸻

SECTION 8 — HOW THE AUDIT WORKS (Missing)

Heading

What happens when you book a free audit

Subheading

You’ll leave the call knowing exactly what’s leaking leads in your business.

3-Step Timeline UI
	1.	15 min audit call
We review your enquiry flow and where leads drop off.
	2.	We map your system
We show you what we’d automate and how it works.
	3.	Fast setup (days, not months)
If you want it, we install it and launch it.

⸻

SECTION 9 — PACKAGES (Revamped pricing anchor)

Even if you don’t want full pricing, you need anchors.

Heading

Simple packages

Subheading

Choose the level of automation you want — we handle setup and launch.

3 Pricing Cards

Starter
For businesses who want fast follow-up
	•	AI replies
	•	basic qualification
	•	booking integration
CTA: Book Audit

Growth
For businesses with consistent enquiries
	•	everything in Starter
	•	reminders
	•	dashboard

CTA: Book Audit

Scale

	•	custom workflows
	•	multi-agent handling
	•	deeper reporting

Pricing line (anchor)

Most clients invest between $X and $Y depending on setup.

(You can set X/Y later.)

⸻

SECTION 10 — FAQ (Stronger objection killers)

Heading

Questions people usually ask

FAQ items to include:
	•	Does this replace my receptionist?
No — it removes missed leads and admin, and your team can step in when needed.
	•	What if the AI says the wrong thing?
It follows a controlled script + rules. We also monitor and improve it.
	•	Do I need new software?
Usually no. We connect to what you already use.
	•	How fast can we launch?
Most setups go live within days.
	•	Can it handle multiple languages?
Yes — the system can reply in the customer’s language.
	•	Do you lock me into contracts?
No long contracts. We win by results.

⸻

SECTION 11 — FINAL CTA (Revamped)

Heading

Stop losing leads you already paid for.

Subheading

Book a free audit and we’ll show you exactly how many calls you could be missing each week.

CTA: Book a Free Audit
Microcopy: No pressure. Just clarity.

⸻

BONUS SECTION (Optional but powerful)

“What you’re losing by replying late”

A simple stat-based section:

If you reply 2 hours later, most leads are already gone.
This system fixes that permanently.

⸻

VISUAL DESIGN UPGRADES (specific)

1) Add “Section Visual Blocks”

Every section needs a visual:
	•	system carousel
	•	demo UI
	•	timeline
	•	package cards
	•	FAQ

2) Upgrade spacing

Your page is clean already, but this revamp should:
	•	increase padding between sections
	•	add consistent max width
	•	add “section headers” with the same style

3) Add subtle background gradients

Not loud. Just:
	•	faint green glow behind CTAs
	•	faint blue/pink behind hero

4) Add a “sticky CTA” on mobile

This is massive for conversion:
	•	a small bottom bar:
Book Free Audit

⸻

What I can do next (fast)

If you want, I can now generate:

1) A Codex build prompt for the entire revamp

(Section-by-section implementation)

2) The exact React/Next component structure

So the site becomes modular like:
	•	<Hero />
	•	<SystemCarousel />
	•	<Outcomes />
	•	<DemoProof />
	•	<ForWho />
	•	<Deliverables />
	•	<WhyUs />
	•	<AuditTimeline />
	•	<Pricing />
	•	<FAQ />
	•	<FinalCTA />
